Single linked list goes one way
Each node contains a value(int) and a reference
It has a head and also a tail(last node)
The last tail contains reference is null

In the linked list it's good to use break point to find the bug

**
Never use head = head.next
**
You are going to move the head to the last of the list

We don't know what's the size of the linked list
If we create an array to store linked list values, we guess the array size
